#Network Security (Simple Port Scanner)

#üìú Script Summary
#Scans specified TCP ports on a target device and reports which are open/closed.

#üîç Explanation
#socket: Standard Python library for network connections.
#connect_ex(): Attempts TCP connection; returns 0 if successful.
#ports list: Define which ports you want to check.
#settimeout(): Prevents script from hanging if host doesn‚Äôt respond.
#Loop: Iterates through ports and checks connectivity.

#Useful for quick port checks, firewall troubleshooting,
#and verifying if services (SSH, HTTP, SNMP, etc.) are reachable.
