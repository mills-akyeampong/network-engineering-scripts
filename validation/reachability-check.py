#🔄 Network Automation (Device Reachability Check)

#📜 Script Summary
#Reads device IPs, pings them, and checks SSH accessibility.

#🔍 Explanation
#devices.txt: File containing list of IP addresses (one per line).
#subprocess.run(): Pings the device to test reachability.
#Netmiko ConnectHandler: Attempts SSH login if device responds.
#Exception handling: Catches SSH failures gracefully.
#print(): Shows success/failure for each step.

#Useful for inventory validation, troubleshooting connectivity,
#and quickly verifying which devices are accessible in a network.
